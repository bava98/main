== About the project

RestOrRant is a command line application that my team and I had to work on for a Software Engineering project.
Given a basic code for an address book, we had the choice of enhancing or morphing it into a desktop application that
 caters to specific users' needs.

We decided to morph it into RestOrRant (ROR), a restaurant management application for restaurant managers,
 waiters and cashiers. It is designed for them to perform front-end operations more efficiently like
 managing tables, handling orders, tracking the availability of menu items and calculating statistical data using the
 Command Line Interface (CLI).

RestOrRant is split into 4 main features: Tables, Orders, Menu and Statistics. To cater to needs of the user, modes
were created to make the application user-friendly.*Restaurant Mode*, *Table Mode*, *Menu Mode* and *Statistics Mode*
 are modes meant to handle these 4 features respectively. Each of my teammates are in
charge of one feature and mine was Statistics. In the following sections, I will be elaborating more on my
contributions and extract relevant parts from the User and Developer Guides that I wrote for the Statistics feature.+

== Summary of contributions

Overall, my role in this project encompasses managing the UI components, Statistics feature, documentation, project
deadline and deliverable. The following provides a detailed summary of the coding, documentation and other helpful
contributions
 I have contributed to the team project.

. *Major Commands implemented*

.. *Calling for bill*: added the ability to *calculate and record the bill* of a specific table.
** What it does: allows users to calculate and record the total bill accumulated from the table's orders.
** Justification: This feature is necessary to update the restaurant revenue, status of the specified tables and the
popularity of the menu items that were ordered.
** Highlights: This command is only usable in Table Mode.

.. *Calling for revenue*: added *the ability to get revenue from the specified year, month and date*
** What it does: allows the user to get the required revenue the user specifies.
** Justification: This feature allows the restaurent manager to conveniently calculate and obtain the revenue
he/she wants. It also eliminates the possibility of human errors when calculating the revenue.
** Highlights: This command is only usable for dates, months and years that are valid. In the case where no
date, month or year is specified, the current day's revenue will be returned.
